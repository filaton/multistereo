# Multistereo

A C-program based on [PortAudio](http://portaudio.com) to apply binaural filters on 5-channels audio signals.

## Install

You should start by installing **portaudio**. See [this link](http://portaudio.com/download.html) to do so.

Then, compile the files as usual.

## Usage

Launch the program with `./multistereo`.

It should automatically detect the first five inputs of your soundcard and convolve it with left and right HRTF.
